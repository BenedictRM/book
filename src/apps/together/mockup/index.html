								The basic functionality of the app would be to elect players/users

								each of which will have varying powers.  For this app however powers will
								just be listed as strings rather than implemented.</p><p></p>
								<p>Another idea is to allow players regions be visible on a map and 
								simulating something similar to a typical electorate. If time permits, players
								will be able to launch campaigns before voting occurs</font></p>

			                    data storage method, it will be easy to pull results live into an app 
								and display live election results.  This could initially be done by just displaying
								results with text and as the app progresses it might be possible to display results
								using a map that changed colors depending on how results are occuring.  An early idea would
								be to limit the game to two parties and two candidates that everyone votes on to limit the
								scope.  This would make it easier to display the map.</font></p>
